## ✅ SAFETY REQUIREMENTS (Check all that apply)

```
[ ] Create timestamped backup on C: before ANY operations
[ ] Copy files to D: first (NO deletion until verified)
[ ] Generate verification report (file counts, sizes, checksums)
[ ] Test all systems on D: (Memory.ps1, AITeam, VS Code)
[ ] Keep C: drive originals for 7 days after migration
[ ] Create rollback script in case I need to go back
[ ] Verify git repos maintain history
```

## 🔒 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**Answer these before we proceed:**

1. **Do you have enough space on D:?**
   - Current workspace size: `_______ GB`
   - Available on D: drive: `_______ GB`

2. **Are any files currently open?**
   - [ ] VS Code closed
   - [ ] Python scripts stopped
   - [ ] All terminals closed
   - [ ] Obsidian closed (if using)

3. **Backup confirmation:**
   - [ ] I have a separate backup (external drive/cloud)
   - [ ] OR I want the script to create one first

4. **Testing window:**
   - [ ] I can test for 10-15 minutes after migration
   - [ ] I can keep C: files for at least 24 hours
