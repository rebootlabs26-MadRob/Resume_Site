# ReBoot Lab — Technical Lab Overview
A dedicated engineering environment for diagnostics, repair workflows, embedded systems, and multi‑system monitoring.

---

## Mission
ReBoot Lab exists to build **repeatable, reliable, appliance‑style diagnostic tools** and **structured workflows** that make troubleshooting faster, clearer, and more consistent.  
The lab supports hardware repair, embedded‑system development, monitoring dashboards, and multi‑device orchestration.
