About Me
I’m an IT support professional with a broad, hands‑on background in PC repair, diagnostics, troubleshooting, and technical operations. I’ve spent over a decade working across repair shops, multi‑store management, QA inspection, security operations, and solar‑plant maintenance — and through all of it, I’ve built a reputation for being reliable, steady, and able to adapt to whatever the job demands.
I’m not someone who claims to be an “expert” in everything. Instead, I’m someone who learns fast, works hard, and has real experience across a wide range of systems, tools, and environments. I’m comfortable supporting users, diagnosing hardware and software issues, documenting processes, and working independently in remote roles.
I take pride in being the person people can count on — whether it’s customers, coworkers, or leadership.

What I Bring
• 	Reliability first. I show up, I follow through, and I take ownership of my work.
• 	Leadership experience. I’ve run three storefronts, trained technicians, and improved workflows.
• 	Versatility. I’ve worked in repair, QA, security, solar maintenance, and technical operations.
• 	Remote‑readiness. I’m comfortable with remote tools, documentation, and independent problem‑solving.
• 	Broad technical range. PC repair, diagnostics, networking basics, OS troubleshooting, monitoring tools, and more.
• 	Always learning. I’m constantly improving my skills — from Python basics to web design to embedded systems.
